## Game rules:
- You start with empty map and ghosts on it.
- Your goal is to fill the empty space and capture the ghosts by building a wall around them.
- You can advance to the next level once 80% of the space is filled.
- If ghost hits you or your path, you die - you have 5 lives.
- Try to get the power-ups that appear randomly around the screen, they can speed you up or freeze ghosts for a moment.

Good luck :wink:
